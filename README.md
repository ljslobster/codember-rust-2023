## How to run challenges
Each challenge is in its own folder and can be run independently.

To run a challenge, navigate to the challenge's directory in your terminal. For example, for challenge 01, you would use:

```bash
cd codember-rust-2023/[the-challenge]
```

Before you can run the challenge, you will need to build it. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
cargo build
```

```bash
cargo run
```
These commands assume that you are using Rust and have cargo installed on your system.
